So here's <a href="https://www.bestdiscgolfdiscs.com/">www.bestdiscgolfdiscs.com</a>.

Well, first off, it looks way nicer. I did a "command + f" page search for "CSS", and there were 93 matches. So I'd imagine learning CSS is going to let me make my little site look much more professional. I think primarily what makes www.bestdiscgolfdiscs.com such a great site is its content, but the fact that it's so easy to navigate is what solidifies its status as an excellent website. I definitely recognize some of the HTML content, but it kind of feels like I spent three hours using Duolingo to learn French, and now I'm trying to read the original French version of a Marcel Proust book or something.</p>
