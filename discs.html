  <title>Disc Recommendations for Beginners</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>An extremely brief rationale for these recommendations:</h1>
    <p>To compete at a high level, a disc golfer needs to have a large variety of lines that they can consistently throw. When a new player starts off, their form and arm speed will limit how their discs fly, but it's still possible to make smart disc choices that make the most basic flight paths attainable.</p>

    <p>In general, there are three types of discs:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Putters</li>
        <li>Mid-Range Discs</li>
        <li>Drivers (broken into Fairway and Distance categories)</li>
      </ol>
    <p>To slightly complicate things, all discs fall on a spectrum of overstable to understable. Assuming you are right-handed and throwing the disc with a standard backhand motion:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More overstable = The disc will "want" to fade off to the left</li>
        <li>More understable = The disc will "want" to turn to the right</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    Disc manufacturers provide ratings for their discs based on how overstable or understable they are. It's also important to note that every disc receives a "speed" rating.
    <br><br><strong>-----A speed rating does not mean "This disc will fly this fast."-----</strong>
    <br><br>
    This is where most beginners go horribly wrong. They want to throw farther, and they assume a higher speed disc will make this happen. However, the speed rating actually means something more along the lines of <em>this is approximately how fast you need to throw this disc to make it fly the way it's supposed to</em>, so they'll usually end up with a disc that flies super overstable. This is why you'll see so many players at your local course throwing extremely ugly shots that come out of the hand and almost immediately crash to the left with no glide.
    </p>
    <h1>So what should I throw?</h1>
    <p>The following discs have been selected to eliminate the frustration of trying to throw "too much disc." These will be the proper tools to learn how to play; if something with your throw is going wrong, it will not be the disc's fault, which is a super important variable to elimiate.
